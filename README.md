Documenting censorship in HTTP
==============================

[IETF 99](https://ietf.org/meeting/99/index.html)
[Hackathon](https://ietf.org/hackathon/99-hackathon.html) will host a
project that aims to use [HTTP response code
451](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7725) to increase transparency and
visibility of censorship.

Several subprojects are proposed:

 * an indexer of censored web pages

 * plugins for popular CMSes that make it as easy to mark a webpage as
   blocked as it is to delete or unpublish it.
 
 * A web browser plugin that detects response code 451

issue](https://github.com/451hackathon/451hackathon/issues/new) to
join the [Github 451hackathon
organization](https://github.com/451hackathon).

We have our own XMPP conference room specifically for this project!
