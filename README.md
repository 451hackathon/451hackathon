Documenting censorship in HTTP
==============================

[IETF 99](https://ietf.org/meeting/99/index.html)
[Hackathon](https://ietf.org/hackathon/99-hackathon.html) will host a
project that aims to use [HTTP response code
451](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7725) to increase transparency of
censorship.

Several subprojects are proposed:

 * an indexer of censored web pages

 * plugins for popular CMSes that make it as easy to mark a webpage as
   blocked as it is to delete or unpublish it.
 
 * A web browser plugin that detects response code 451

If you have a github account, please [open an
issue](https://github.com/451hackathon/451hackathon/issues/new) to
join the [Github 451hackathon
organization](https://github.com/451hackathon).

We'll have an XMPP conference room up and running specifically for
this project, but it hasn't been allocated yet.  Until that's set up,
please [join
hackathon@jabber.ietf.org](xmpp:hackathon@kjabber.ietf.org?join) for
real-time chat.
